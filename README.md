1) Need S3 bucket to get and store the handwriting candidate
2) Need frond end EC2 machine, to have the index web page to display on EC2 machine
3) Need back end EC2 machine with Python, so we can run the keras_flask.py file on it
(link both and run)
(and mind the namings and IP addresses to match..)
